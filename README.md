Assignment Brief/Context 
You   are   a   business   analyst   working   for   a   leading   independent   New   Zealand   business   consultancy firm – “712 Consultants”   .Your   manager, Dr Wang, has assigned you the task of   studying   New Zealand's food export   performance   over   the   past   six   years,   both   prior   to   and   after   the   COVID-19   pandemic.   You're expected to analyse the impact of   COVID-19 on New Zealand's food export items.   For this task, Dr Wang has   supplied a United Nations   COMTRADE   dataset.   This   dataset   encompasses all records, detailing commodity items and their corresponding trade values,   pertaining to New Zealand's   exports to   its trade   partners.   It's   important   to   clarify   that   the   years   2020,   2021,   and   2022   are   designated   as   the   years   of   the   COVID-19   pandemic.   Furthermore,    for    precision    in    terminology,      it's    more      appropriate      to      refer      to      it      as      a   'pandemic' rather than an 'epidemic'.The   detailed   data   is   available   in   an   Excel   file   named   “TradeData.xlsx”,   which   has   been   uploaded   to   module   ‘B: Important Information  Assessments 代 写BUSMGT 712 Group Project Quarter Three 2024Matlab

Detailed Tasks 
Dr   Wang   would   like   you   to   analyse   the WHOLE dataset provided   using   regression   as   well   as   descriptive   methods   of analysis.   Therefore,   your   analysis   should   include   a   brief   analysis   of descriptive statistics (such   as mean, median,   standard   deviation,   correlation,   distribution,   confidence   interval,   hypothesis   testing   etc.)   as   well   as visualisations of the   data and regression results as the key   focus.
Detailed Tasks 
You are required to answer the following questions by using regressions:
1.       What factors affect New Zealand's food exports?   And how?
2.       Can   Free   Trade   Agreement   (FTA)   help   New   Zealand   export   more   food   to   its   trade   partners?
3.       How has COVID-19 affected   New Zealand exports? (e.g. overall vs. each export item)
4.    Can   FTA   offset   the   negative   effect   of COVID-19   on New   Zealand   exports?   Or   Can   FTA   boost   the   positive   effect   of   COVID-19 on   New   Zealand   exports? If   so, how?
You can construct a single regression model to answer all four questions, or, alternatively,   build separate models to address each question   individually.For this assignment, you should collect additional variables (e.g. dummy of   FTA,   GDP   of each country, etc.) to answer the   above   questions.   Furthermore,   you   may   also   derive   new   variables (e.g. GDP per capita=GDP/Population   Size) by using   the   existing   and   collected   additional   data   if   needed.
Your manager would like you to   address the questions   above   by   submitting   a   2000-word written report.
Guide on the Usage of Generative AI for Group Assignment 
As you embark on this group assignment, it is   crucial to   integrate   Generative   AI tools
ethically, responsibly, and in alignment with the academic standards   of   our university.   Here   are some   guidelines:
1) Understanding AI in Coursework: Recognise that AI tools, such as   ChatGPT,   can   enhance learning and analytical capabilities. However, they should not replace your      critical thinking or understanding. Use these tools as aids, not as your sole   source   of   information.
2) Academic Honesty: Maintain   integrity   and   honesty   in   your   submissions. If   you utilise Generative AI tools, you must clearly declare their use in your work. This   includes stating how these tools were used and the prompts provided to generate responses. Ensure that your use of   AI aligns with the task's educational goals and   does not breach any academic integrity policies. Please detail this information within an appendix to your report. This   appendix   should   serve   as   a   clear   record   of   the   role Generative   AI   played   in   your   work, supporting   the   integrity   and   transparency   of   your research process. 
3) Data Sensitivity and Privacy: Be cautious about the   information   you   input   into   any      AI   tool. Assess   the   sensitivity   of   databased   on   university   guidelines   and   ensure   that you do not use restricted data within these platforms. Public data can be utilised more freely, but always consider privacy and ethical implications.
4) Creative and Critical Engagement: Utilise AI to foster creativity and   critical
thinking within your group. Challenge the output provided by AI tools, verify its accuracy, and use it as a starting point   for   deeper   analysis rather than   as   an   end result.
5) Reporting and Reflection: Incorporate an appendix into your report,   specifically
dedicated to detailing how AI tools were employed throughout your assignment. This   appendix should comprehensively discuss the roles these tools played, highlighting the advantages and challenges you encountered, as well   as the   ethical   considerations you considered important. Provide concrete examples to illustrate how AI contributed   to your research findings and analytical processes. This approach will   ensure   clarity            and   maintain   the   academic   integrity   of   your   work, allowing   readers   to   understand   the    extent   and   impact   of   AI   on   your   project.
6) Academic Honesty Declaration: Each group member must agree to an academic   honesty declaration, acknowledging that the work submitted is original, without unauthorised assistance, and respects the university's guidelines on AI usage.
By following these guidelines, you ensure that your use of   Generative AI tools is responsible, ethical, and in line with academic standards, while also   enhancing   your   learning   experience and the quality of   your work. Remember, these tools are here to augment your education, not to replace the hard work and critical thinking that form. the cornerstone of   academic achievement. 
Please include the Academic Honesty Declaration as the second page of your team's report, immediately following the cover page. If   your report   includes   a   Table   of Contents,   place      the      declaration      before      it. The inclusion of this declaration in your report will be interpreted   as   all   team   members   collectively   agreeing   to   its   terms.   It   will   be   considered   as   if   each   team   member has personally   signed   the   declaration,   affirming   your team's   commitment   to upholding academic integrity throughout your project.
